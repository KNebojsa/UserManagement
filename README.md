Running the Project and Applying Migrations

This project uses Entity Framework Core (Code-First) with .NET 8.0, which is the latest stable Long-Term Support (LTS) version at the time of development.

Why .NET 8?

While .NET 9.0 is available, it is not a long-term support release. For stability and support reasons, .NET 8.0 was chosen. This ensures the project benefits from the latest stable features while maintaining long-term reliability.

Upgrading to newer versions like .NET 9 or beyond can be considered once they reach LTS status.
